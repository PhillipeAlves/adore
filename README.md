# Front End Developer Task

Build a catalogue page using the Adore beauty API, with a list screen and single detail screen. There should be a header with the company logo and a footer with the developer name and current year.

- Fetch list of product resources asynchronously from

https://adorebeauty.com.au/api/ecommerce/catalog/products

https://adorebeauty.com.au/api/ecommerce/catalog/categories

You can view the available documentation at https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/catalog/products/getproducts

https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/catalog/category/getcategories

- Resources should be stored in state / redux / vuex

- Show loading view during API fetch

- Filters and categories name available are shown in the response -

- Display home resource list as tabular data

- When table row is clicked, single detailed resource page is shown

- Show pagination with 100 (filtered) results per page

- Show single resource with title, sku, current_price, categories and image if applicable
